# Tune-Traveler
A musical implementation of the A* path-finding algorithm.
Project is as detailed in the FP4-Proposal repository.

## TODO
* Add a better selection of randomized sounds to play as the player moves on the grid.
* Implement A* path-finding algorithm so that program finds shortest path from A to B.
* Create preset grid layouts for testing and demonstration.
* Add more interesting graphical effects. (Stretch Goal)
